Reactive Spring
Project Reactor,the reactive programming library that underpins Spring’s reactive features.
WebFlux, a webframework that borrows much from Spring MVC while offering a new reactive model for web development.
RSocket, a communication protocol that enables a reactive alternative to HTTP.

we can write two styles of code—imperative and reactive, which are described as follows:
Reactive programming is a paradigm that’s an alternative to imperative programming.

Consequently, blocking web frameworks won’t scale effectively under heavy
request volume.

Asynchronous web frameworks, in contrast, achieve higher scalability with fewer
threads—generally one per CPU core. By applying a technique known as event looping
(as illustrated in figure 12.1), these frameworks are able to handle many requests per
thread, making the per-connection cost more economical.
An interesting side effect of using WebFlux instead of Spring MVC is that the default
embedded server for WebFlux is Netty instead of Tomcat. Netty is one of a handful of
asynchronous, event-driven servers and is a natural fit for a reactive web framework
like Spring WebFlux.
